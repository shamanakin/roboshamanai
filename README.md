| **MAP** | Strategy audit with actionable 30-day roadmap | $297 flat fee |

## Built in Public

This repository contains the full source code for [roboshamanai.com](https://roboshamanai.com). The entire site was designed, coded, and deployed using AI-assisted development — practicing what we preach.

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Backend:** PHP (contact form)
- **Fonts:** Outfit (headings) + Inter (body) via Google Fonts
- **Design System:** Glassmorphism with indigo/emerald accents
- **Hosting:** Static files + PHP on DreamHost

No frameworks. No build tools. Just clean, performant code.

## The Human Behind the Code

RSAi is led by a practicing psychotherapist who built his own successful private practice and SaaS ([BrightEyedTherapist](https://brighteyedtherapist.com)) using these exact methods.

> "Years of training in understanding how people get stuck — and unstuck — didn't disappear when I started building software. I translate complicated technical concepts into plain language, help you identify what's actually blocking progress, and build systems that match how you actually work."
